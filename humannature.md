# Human Nature

```
(Mencius and Martin Luther are seated at a table, discussing their beliefs about human nature.)

Mencius: I believe that human nature is inherently good, because I believe that we all have an innate sense of morality within us.

Martin Luther: But that is a dangerous and false belief! Human beings are inherently sinful and corrupt. Our very nature is a reflection of the fall from grace that we experienced in the Garden of Eden.

Mencius: I understand your perspective, but I believe that our capacity for goodness is what sets us apart from the animals. For example, if we see someone in need, our natural inclination is to help them, rather than to turn a blind eye.

Martin Luther: That may be true, but it does not negate the fact that we are all sinners, and that our natural inclinations are often towards vice and selfishness.

Mencius: But it is precisely because of our natural inclinations towards goodness that we are capable of change and improvement. With proper education and guidance, we can cultivate our virtues and become better people.

Martin Luther: Education and guidance cannot save us from our sinful nature. Only faith in God and the grace of Christ can do that.

Mencius: I understand your position, but I do not believe that faith in God is necessary for us to lead good and virtuous lives.

Martin Luther: Then you are gravely mistaken! Without faith in God, we are lost and hopeless, condemned to an eternity of damnation.

Mencius: I do not accept that view of the world. I believe that we can find meaning and purpose in our own lives, without relying on a higher power to guide us.

Martin Luther: But that is a dangerous and arrogant belief! We are all subject to the laws of God, whether we acknowledge them or not.

Mencius: I do not believe that the laws of God are the only source of morality in the world. I believe that we can discover moral truths through our own reason and intuition.

Martin Luther: And I believe that our reason and intuition are flawed, because of our sinful nature. It is only through the grace of Christ that we can hope to understand the true nature of the world and our place in it.

Mencius: I respect your beliefs, but I cannot accept them as my own. I believe that we must each find our own way in the world, according to our own principles and convictions.

Martin Luther: And I believe that our way is determined by the will of God, whether we recognize it or not. We are all sinners in need of redemption and salvation.

Mencius: I cannot accept your view of the world, but I do believe that we can still learn from each other, even if we do not agree.

Martin Luther: And I believe that we must each follow the path that God has laid out for us, whether it is easy or difficult, pleasant or unpleasant.

Mencius: (sighing) I fear we may never see eye to eye on this issue, but I am glad that we can at least discuss it civilly and respectfully.

Martin Luther: (nodding) Agreed. It is important to have these kinds of conversations, even if they challenge our beliefs and assumptions.

Mencius: (smiling) Perhaps we can continue this conversation over a pint of ale?

Martin Luther: (laughing) Now that sounds like a plan.
