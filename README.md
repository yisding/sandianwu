## Inspiration

Writing has always been one of my achilles heels. That might be a surprise for people who know me, since I enjoy talking, maybe to excess, and even in work environments it's not uncommon for me to write more emails or slack messages than the rest of the team of 10 combined.

But indeed, writing, especially lengthy papers or assignments, has been one of my life's biggest challenges. The first assignment I ever truly had trouble in school was a paper in elementary school. And then later on, I failed several classes in high school and college due to my inability to write papers of length. Ironically, one of the few professors I keep in touch with regularly taught the technical writing course at University, but even he might remember that I got an incomplete the first semester and had to resubmit my work the following semester.

However, there might be some hope on the horizon. We have recently come across a technology that promises to write grammatically correct, insightful, unending prose, and even poetry, without complaint for $20/month. That technology, of course, is the eponymous Shalosh dot Chamesh. So, I thought it would be fun to do a little collaboration. Let's see what happens.

### Name

We have a good family friend who was a pioneer in the field of computer assisted publishing. Over the years, he and his collaborator, Shalosh B Ekhad, wrote some wonderful papers that were published in some very prestigious places. So it's in homage that I have named my collaborator Shalosh dot Chamesh. I should be clear here that there is no actual familial relationship between the two Shaloshes.
