# Dear Helen,

When you read this, you and I will probably both be several years older.

Being your father has been one of the great joys and privileges of my life. Thank you for letting me be your father.

Like any parent, I have some hopes for how you grow up. They include:

1. Selfishly, as we are steadily advancing towards the days when we will see each other less frequently, I hope you will continue to make time to see your mom and I. Whether you're dropping in from across town or you're on a video call from Switzerland, do know that it will always be one of the highlights of our day to see you.
2. You've always had a knack for making friends, and I hope that you will continue to make friends and keep friends who care about you and support you.
3. I hope you will continue learning throughout your life, and always remember that the way to make the hard things easy is through time and practice.
4. I hope that you will continue to stay active and remain in good health.
5. I forsee you going to many new places, even places that I have never been or will never get the opportunity to go to. You've always been fond of new hotels, and I hope you never grow tired of them, and continue to enjoy the pools and the ocean as much as you have.
6. Hopefully you will never experience any major difficulties in life, but if you do, please remember that you overcame your biggest difficulty at the age of 4.
7. I'm sure there will be some times when you will be feeling unhappy, and I hope that during those times you will remember that your mother and father will always support you no matter what and we will always love you 100%.
8. I hope that you and your siblings will continue to support one another and love one another, that you will support your mother as she grows older and especially if I pass away first. I hope you remember that as a family there's nothing we can't get through if we stick together.

You've grown so much Helen. I love you.

Your Dad

Dear Helen,

Being your father is a joy and privilege,
That I cherish more than words can express.
As we both age and time passes,
My hopes for you remain quite straightforward.

May you always find time for family,
No matter how far your path may lead.
May you continue to make friends who care,
And lift you up when life gets tough to bear.

May you never tire of learning and growth,
And always seek to new horizons.
May you stay healthy, active, and happy,
And find beauty in life's simple and complex.

May you travel to places near and far,
And experience the world with wonder.
And if life brings you difficulties and pain,
Know that you're not alone, and we'll help you remain.

Helen, you've grown into a remarkable young woman,
And your worth is priceless.
As you journey through life, always remember this,
That our love for you is unconditional and endless.

Always,
Dad.
