# Pilates

```
There once was a person in need
Whose backache caused them to plead
They signed up for Pilates to relieve
But alas, they could not foresee
Now soreness they feel constantly, indeed.
```

Shalosh, the perpetual optimist of our duo, suggested this "improvement":

```
A person with a painful back
Signed up for Pilates to get on track
With hopes that it would bring relief
But soon discovered a new source of grief

Their muscles sore from every move
The pain now constant, hard to soothe
They had not foreseen this side effect
And wondered if they should neglect

But with perseverance, they pushed through
And soon, the pain began to subdue
Their back grew strong, their posture tall
No longer did they feel so small

So while it seemed like a tough start
The benefits began to play their part
Pilates became a part of their routine
A choice they were grateful to have seen.
```

So of course I had to craft this response

```
Joseph Pilates was a mighty fine fellar
Started a movement to make people feel better
Spread his teachings far and wide
If I met him, Iâ€™d sue his hide
```
