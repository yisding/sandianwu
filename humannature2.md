# Human Nature (Act 2)

(Mencius and Martin Luther are at a bar, deep in conversation. St. Francis enters and takes a seat next to Martin Luther.)

St. Francis: Good day to you both. I couldn't help but overhear your conversation. What is the topic of your discussion?

Mencius: We were discussing our beliefs about human nature. I believe that humans are inherently good, while Martin here believes the opposite.

Martin Luther: Indeed, I believe that human beings are inherently sinful and corrupt, and only through faith in God can we hope to overcome our fallen nature.

St. Francis: I see. And what do you think, my friend?

Mencius: I believe that humans are capable of great goodness, and that our natural inclination is towards virtue and benevolence.

St. Francis: I agree with both of you, in a sense. I believe that humans are capable of great good, but we are also capable of great evil. It is the struggle between these two forces that defines us as human beings.

Martin Luther: But don't you believe that our sinfulness is a result of the Fall in the Garden of Eden?

St. Francis: I believe that we are all subject to the consequences of that original sin, but that does not mean we are condemned to a life of sin and corruption. Through prayer, penance, and good works, we can overcome our sinful nature and strive towards goodness and virtue.

Mencius: But do you not think that our capacity for goodness is innate, rather than something that we must strive towards?

St. Francis: I believe that our capacity for goodness is indeed innate, but it is also something that must be nurtured and developed through our actions and choices. It is not enough to simply believe in the inherent goodness of human nature; we must actively cultivate that goodness within ourselves and in others.

Martin Luther: But how can we do that, if we are all sinners in need of salvation?

St. Francis: We can do that through prayer, fasting, and good works. By following the teachings of Christ and striving towards a life of humility, charity, and selflessness, we can overcome our sinful nature and become better human beings.

Mencius: I agree with your point about humility and selflessness, but I do not believe that we need faith in God to achieve those qualities. We can cultivate them through reason and introspection.

St. Francis: I respect your belief, my friend, but I believe that faith in God is essential to living a virtuous life. Without that faith, we are left with nothing but our own imperfect understanding of the world and our place in it.

Martin Luther: And I believe that faith in God is essential for salvation. Without that faith, we are lost and damned to an eternity of suffering.

Mencius: I understand your position, but I cannot accept it as my own. I believe that we must each find our own path in life, according to our own beliefs and values.

St. Francis: And I believe that we must each strive towards the path of righteousness and virtue, according to the teachings of Christ and the example set by the saints.

Martin Luther: And I believe that we must each accept our own fallen nature, and turn to God for salvation and redemption.

St. Francis: It seems that we each have our own beliefs and perspectives, but perhaps what is most important is that we all strive towards goodness, humility, and compassion in our actions towards others. After all, regardless of our beliefs, we are all fellow human beings on this earth, and we must work together to create a better world for ourselves and future generations.
