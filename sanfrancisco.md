# San Francisco

Act 1, Scene 1:

St. Francis and the Devil appear in the heart of San Francisco, a bustling city filled with people. The Devil grins, enjoying the chaos and energy of the city. St. Francis, on the other hand, looks solemn and contemplative.

St. Francis: (gazing at the city) So much has changed since my time. This city has grown so much, but it is filled with so much suffering.

The Devil: (grinning) Ah, but what a city it is! The energy, the ambition, the money - it's all here.

St. Francis: (sighs) And yet, there is so much inequality. So many people suffering, living on the streets.

The Devil: (smirks) Oh, don't worry about them. They'll figure it out. Survival of the fittest, you know.

St. Francis: (shakes his head) No, that is not the way. We must care for all our brothers and sisters, especially those who are suffering.

Act 1, Scene 2:

St. Francis and the Devil walk the streets of San Francisco, passing by groups of homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk. The Devil sneers at them, while St. Francis looks on with sadness.

St. Francis: (approaching a group of homeless people) My dear friends, how can I help you?

Homeless Person 1: (surprised) Who are you?

St. Francis: I am St. Francis of Assisi. I have come to offer my help and my prayers.

Homeless Person 2: (cynical) Prayers won't put food in our bellies or a roof over our heads.

St. Francis: (nodding) I understand. But let us pray together, and perhaps we can find a way to help each other.

Act 2, Scene 1:

St. Francis and the Devil enter a high-rise building, where they are greeted by a group of wealthy tech entrepreneurs. The Devil grins at them, while St. Francis looks on with concern.

Tech Entrepreneur 1: (excitedly) Welcome to San Francisco! We're so glad you could come and visit us.

The Devil: (smirking) Yes, this is quite the city you've built here. So much ambition, so much money.

St. Francis: (quietly) And yet, there is so much suffering.

Tech Entrepreneur 2: (confused) Suffering? What do you mean?

St. Francis: (gesturing to the homeless people outside) Look around you. These are your brothers and sisters, and they are suffering.

Act 2, Scene 2:

St. Francis and the Devil walk through the streets of San Francisco once more, this time stopping at a park where a group of children are playing. The Devil watches them with amusement, while St. Francis looks on with joy.

St. Francis: (smiling) Look at these children. They are so full of life and joy.

The Devil: (rolling his eyes) Yes, they are. But what does that matter?

St. Francis: (earnestly) It matters because they are the future. We must protect them, and all children, and give them a world where they can thrive.

Act 3, Scene 1:

St. Francis and the Devil stand before the Mayor of San Francisco, who looks both impressed and slightly unnerved by their presence.

Mayor: (nervously) Uh, welcome to San Francisco. What can I do for you?

St. Francis: (serene) We have come to offer our guidance and assistance.

The Devil: (grinning) And our opinions.

Mayor: (cautiously) I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure what you mean by opinions.

The Devil: (smirking) Oh, just a few thoughts on how to make this city even more profitable. You know, things like deregulation, tax breaks, and cutting social services.

St. Francis: (firmly) No, that is not the way. We must prioritize the common good, not just the interests of the wealthy.

Mayor: (conflicted) It's not that simple. There are a lot of competing interests in this city, and we have to balance them all.

St. Francis: (nodding) I understand. But let us work together, and we can find a way to serve all the people of this city, not just the powerful.

Act 3, Scene 2:

St. Francis and the Devil walk through the city once more, this time stopping at a church. St. Francis kneels to pray, while the Devil looks on with contempt.

St. Francis: (praying) Lord, help us to build a world of peace and justice, where all your children can thrive.

The Devil: (sneering) What a waste of time.

St. Francis: (rising) No, it is not a waste of time. Prayer is our connection to the divine, and through it, we can find the strength to do good in the world.

The Devil: (laughing) You're so naive. This world is about power and wealth, not prayer and goodness.

St. Francis: (calmly) No, that is where you are wrong. The true power is in love and compassion, not in domination and greed.

Epilogue:

St. Francis and the Devil depart from San Francisco, leaving behind a city that is both richer and poorer for their visit. The homeless people are still on the streets, the tech entrepreneurs are still making money, and the Mayor is still trying to balance it all. But something has shifted, a small seed of hope and possibility planted in the midst of chaos and despair. And perhaps, just perhaps, that seed will grow into a world where love and compassion reign, and all God's children are cherished and cared for.

*(ed: The devil has certainly lead to a better constructed play. Perhaps a strong antagonist is what's needed to shake Shalosh's need to make everyone agreeable. Still, it's missing some soul.)*
*(ed2: A careful reading might show that the devil might have certain political leanings. Is this evidence of Shalosh's woke bias, or is it an accurate synthesis of the state of politics in this country?)*
