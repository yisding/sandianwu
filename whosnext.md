# Who's Next?

```
First Google got AI and that was good,
'Cause they're not evil, understood?
Then Microsoft, but that's O.K.,
'Cause the balance of power's maintained that way!
Who's next?
OpenAI got GPT, but don't you grieve,
'Cause they're nonprofit (I believe).
Amazon got AI, but have no fears;
They can't wipe us out for at least five years!
Who's next?
Then IBM claimed that they
Were gonna get one any day.
HP wants two, no lies:
One for the Inc and one for Enterprise!
Who's next?
Facebook's gonna get one, too,
Just to use on you know who.
So Apple's getting tense,
Wants one in self defense.
"Job's our shepherd," they all cry,
But just in case --- we better get AI!
Who's next?
Roku wants its GPT
But its money's at SVB.
We'll try to stay serene and high
When in the hands of the FBI!
Who's next, who's next, who's next?
Who's next?
